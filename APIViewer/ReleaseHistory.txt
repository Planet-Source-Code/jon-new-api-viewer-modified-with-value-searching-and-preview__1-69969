New API Viewer Release History
--------------------------------------------------------------
April 14, 2007 -- Initial release. Version 1.0.0
April 15, 2007 -- 1.0.1.
		        * Added WinCEAPI.TXT supporting Windows CE
                    API declarations (the stand-alone version
                    can act as a working replacement for the
                    API Viewer that comes with the CE
                    development environment.
                  * Added dependency checking for Constants,
                    where a constant can reference other
                    constants.
                  * Fixed bug in cmdAdd that did not recognize
                    subroutine declarations. D'OH!
April 16, 2007 -- 1.0.2.
                  * Smoothed resizing of main form.
                  * Added over 47,000 new Constants. Added new
                    MAPI constants to API32.TXT. All other new
                    constants supplied in new files
                    API32Const1.txt and API32Const2.txt.
                  * Made sure frmAddConst.frm is unloaded when
                    a new file with new constants is loaded,
                    otherwise, this form still holds the
                    initial constants from the first-loaded file.
May 22, 2007 -- 1.0.3.
	             * Fixed a bug that prevented constants from
                    being looked up interactively using the
                    lookup textbox.
                  * Removed the need for an external Manifest
                    file by embedding it and invoking it from
                    within its new embedded Resource file.
